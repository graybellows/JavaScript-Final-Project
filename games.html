                        Red Dead Redemption is a 2010 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar 
                        San Diego and published by Rockstar Games. A successor to 2004's Red Dead Revolver, 
                        it is the second game in the Red Dead series. Red Dead Redemption is set during the 
                        decline of the American frontier in the year 1911. It follows John Marston, a former outlaw who, 
                        after his wife and son are taken hostage by the government in ransom for his services as a hired gun, 
                        sets out to bring three members of his former gang to justice. The narrative explores themes of the 
                        cycle of violence, masculinity, redemption, and the American Dream.
