                    <h2>Belle Starr (1848 - 1889)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Myra Maybelle Shirley Reed Starr, better known as Belle Starr, was an American outlaw 
                        who gained national notoriety after her violent death.
                        <br><br>
                        She associated with the James–Younger Gang and other outlaws. 
                        She was convicted of horse theft in 1883. She was fatally shot in 1889 
                        in a case that is still officially unsolved. Her story was popularized 
                        by Richard K. Fox — editor and publisher of the National Police 
                        Gazette — and she later became a popular character in television and films.

                    <h2>Jackson Sundown (1863-1923)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Jackson Sundown, born Waaya-Tonah-Toesits-Kahn (meaning Blanket of the Sun), was a 
                        Native American rodeo rider who has become a folk-hero for his mythic performance 
                        in the 1916 Pendleton Round-Up, largely popularized by Ken Kesey's novel The Last Go 'Round.

                        By the age of 14 he was active in the Nez Perce War of 1877, but unlike many of his tribesmen, 
                        Sundown escaped the U.S. Army cavalry during the Nez Perce Retreat and fled to Canada with a 
                        small group of wounded warriors. He was considered to be a war criminal and lived in hiding 
                        with Sitting Bull and others who played a role in the defeat of General George Custer at the Battle of Little Big Horn.

                    <h2>Mary Fields (1832-1914)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mary Fields, also known as Stagecoach Mary and Black Mary, was an American mail 
                        carrier who was the first Black woman to be employed as a star route postwoman in the United States.

                        Fields had the star route contract for the delivery of U.S. mail from Cascade, Montana, 
                        to Saint Peter's Mission. She drove the route for two four-year contracts, from 1895 to 1899 and from 1899 to 1903.
